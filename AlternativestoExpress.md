# Alternatives to Express

## Introduction  
Here I will check if there are any viable alternatives to Express. ALternatives that are workable for me.  
I will look at a few different points to make my case:  
* What alternatives are there?
* How do alternatives and Express compare to each other in features, popularity, funding, ease of use, or other factors?
* Which of those factors do or do not matter to you?  

##  What alternatives are there?  
For this little research I decided to not look for to many alternatives. As I have never worked with Express it is rather difficult  
for me to really see a destinct difference between the framework tools. I decided to compare Express vs. Koa vs. Hapi.  
But there are many more!  

## Express vs. Koa vs. Hapi  
Express has been around the longest 8 years allready. Followed by Hapi (7 years) and then Koa (4 years).  
Furthermore Express is the most popular Node.js web application, followed by Koa and Hapi. You can see this in the table below.
